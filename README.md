Automated Pneumonia detection with Deep learning 
Dataset taken from kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

#########################################################
Inside Keras_model folder we have our final implementation

Training.py - Script to train the model
 
 Input dataset for training.py can be downloaded from above link
 
Build_dataset - Script for pre-processing the training data

Testing.py - Script for loading the saved weights and test the data

Gui.py - Graphical user interface which takes model and input x-ray as input and displays whether the input is affected by pneumonia or not.
